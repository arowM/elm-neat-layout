## Why neat layout?

Enpower you to realize no-hack layouts with neat gaps.

* No quirky collapsing of gaps
* Natural liquid layout
* No need for manual cropping of texts
* No unintentional overflow of contents
* Flexible layout building with fewer APIs

## Why not support styles?

The elm-neat-layout is a framework for building *layouts*, so it does not provide a way to specify *styles* such as background colors, etc. Just use CSS for that purpose!

Wouldn't it be better to use a language especially designed for styles? It would be the similar reason you chose Elm, a language especially designed for TEA. CSS is a good language for styles, though not adequate for layouts.

## Sample applications
